Join the local racers on this loop around the Royal Botanical Garden of Melbourne. There are lots of shade, greenery, views of the Yarra River, and a challenging slope.
",Melbourne,VIC 3004,-37.82404851,144.9768202,"The “Tan” is a hugely popular gravel running route looping around Melbourne’s Royal Botanic Gardens and Kings Domain. The Domain Parklands include Kings Domain, Government House Reserve, Shrine of Remembrance Reserve and the Royal Botanic Gardens, extending to the river.

Running the ‘Tan’ in Melbourne is a thing: the website Run The Tran is a central source for ALL official recorded run times around the 3.827 km (2.378 miles) Tan Track, plus other information and resources.

Add-Ons: The gardens and the ornamental lake they circle are alluring, but it’s also worth checking out the World War I Shrine of Remembrance, monument to lost Oarsmen, and the Government House (where the Governor of Victoria Resides). If you’re lucky, you can catch a Quidditch match in action at the Harry Potter inspired Quidditch Park. Overall, it’s a flat, easy to navigate run that will breeze by with all the greenery and scenery.

You can also enjoy the trails along the Yarra River."

You have ocean, river, and in this case, an enormous lake. Fortunately for runners, the architects of Albert Park had the foresight to build a nearly 7.5 km track along the water’s edge. You can start out anywhere you like along this hard packed gravel strip, but the southeast corner of the park is easily accessible by public transit. Start here, and if you still have energy when you complete the loop, you have easy access to extend your run to Catani Gardens and St. Kilda Pier for a rewarding view of Port Phillip Bay.

Albert Park is also home to Parkrun, a free group 5k held every Saturday morning. You can see the course map and learn more here."

The crown jewel of these is the Capital City Trail, which tracks the Yarra River through the central part of the city. This mostly paved path is the main connector for getting around the city and its parks via bicycle, but it’s also a great flat loop to hop onto for a run of any length. The main section of this trail starts out near the touristy Federation Square. You’ll get to run along Batman Ave (named for founder John Batman, not the Dark Knight). Continue along the northern banks until crossing over to Yarra River Reserve and Herring Island. Then, return via the south bank along Alexandria Ave. In total it’s about 11 km, but you can either do one bank at a time, or cross over on a footbridge midway to shorten your mileage.

There are also lots of options to add on for length or variety, with parks and gardens near either side of the path, as featured in our other Melbourne routes. Or, hop off in the Toorak neighborhood for a look at some of the city’s more ritzy mansions."

One of the earliest areas of publicly reserved land in Melbourne, Yarra Park also contains two scarred trees, similar to the one in the Fitzroy Gardens.

Located in Yarra Park are the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), home to cricket and Australian rules football and the National Sports Museum. From Yarra Park, a footbridge leads to Melbourne Park, home of the Australian Tennis Open."

For beginners, there is a bike path, whilst more confident riders can share the road with the other groups of cyclists. Be wary however, sometimes it can get rather crowded. Beach Road is so popular with cyclists many have taken to social media with the hashtag #notbeachroad to inform people when they’re riding a different route for a change!"
